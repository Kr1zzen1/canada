# modeling.R

# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)

# Step 1: Load cleaned data (this assumes you already ran 'cleaning.R' and have 'cleaned_data.csv')
data <- read.csv('data/cleaned_data.csv')

# Step 2: Run Linear Regression Model
# Predicting supplier diversity score based on transparency score
model <- lm(supplier_diversity_score ~ transparency_score, data = data)

# Step 3: Save the final model as an RDS file
saveRDS(model, 'models/final_model.rds')

# Print message to confirm that the model has been saved
cat("Model saved as final_model.rds\n")
